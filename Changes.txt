Following are the list of updates/changes:-

#1. update folder name from src/main/java to src/test/java becuase test automation script should be keep in test package, main packgae for applicaiton source folder.
 
#2. Created proper tier framework for the automation, separate package for test, page objects, test data file, driver, initiator, base class etc- 
	Structure is like that - 
		-src/test/java
			--com.automation.initiator
			--com.automation.test
			--com.automation.keywords
			--com.automation.getpageobjects
			--com.automation.utils
			--com.automation.reports
		-src/test/resorce
			--PageObjectsRepository
			--TestData
			--Testngxml
			--Selenium Driver
